PHP Solutions, 2nd Edition
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Instructions for how to use these files are in the Introduction to the book
(see page xvii).

The includes folder contains only the following three files:

nuke_magic_quotes.php
recaptchalib.php
utility_funcs.inc.php

The remaining include files are in the folders relating to the chapters
in which they're used. To test files that depend on the include files, you need
to move them to the includes folder yourself. This is because you're encouraged
to build the files yourself as a vital part of the learning process.

All the code can be freely used in your own projects. There is no obligation
to provide a credit to David Powers and PHP Solutions, but it would be 
appreciated.

The images are all copyright of the author, David Powers. They are provided to
help you follow the exercises in the book. If you wish to use them in a public
website, you must first obtain written permission of the author, who can be
